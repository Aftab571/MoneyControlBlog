                            research to understand problems. A few interesting facts are stated below.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    An average typical American student in high school has about 13 outstanding credit
                                    obligations
                                </li>

                                    According to Employee Benefit Research Institute survey, only 14 percent of
                                    American

                                    say that they are "very confident" that they will have enough money to live
                                    comfortably

                                    retirement and 30 percent of workers said they have less than $1,000 in savings and
                                    investments
                                </li>

                            </ul>



                            <p> On the basis of above facts and figures and issues faced by people pertaining to their
                                budgets,
                                our team found out that It is essential that there exists a platform where a user can
                                track
                                and
                                keep a check on his monthly expenditure and savings and hence our team decided to
                                develop a
                                n
                                application which would not only help the user have a log of his transactions but also
                                allow
                                him to visualize his expenditure depending on which he can access each area of
                                expenditure
                                and
                                decides where he needs to have a check and how to do it.</p>

                            <p><b>WHY IS THERE A NEED OF MONEY CONTROL?</b></p>
                            <p>Money Control is an interesting topic to discuss upon. Different people have different
                                reasons
                                and different goals for which they save up money over a period of time. However, one
                                common
                                thing is that everyone needs money in this 21st centaury so that they can lead a
                                comfortable
                                and worry free life. Hence, it is important that people have some tools through which
                                they
                                can
                                keep a track on their money. Also, People tend to spend more when they don’t have a
                                proper
                                visualization of the data. Many people find it confusing at the end of the month or the
                                year
                                when they try to calculate their expenditure or saving and tend to get frustrated and
                                leave
                                the
                                task all together. Once this happens it is impossible for the user to analyze his area
                                of
                                surplus spending and evaluate the areas which provide him/her an option to save by cost
                                cutting
                                methods. Based on all these situations, there is dire need to keep in check our
                                finances
                                for a
                                healthy budget.
                                Based on the above statements, we have a vision of developing an app which would enable
                                the
                                users to maintain a healthy budget. Let the user know their areas of spending and let
                                them
                                visualize and analysis their data so that they can maintain a healthy budget.</p>

                                his
                                requirements, expectations and the important basic features necessary for the
                                application.
                                Once
                                the initial discussion was done, a discussion among the team members took place on how
                                to
                                arrive at the requirements of the user and if there are any additional features apart
                                from
                                that
                                specified by the customer that would further enhance the application.
                                The requirements gathered from the Customer were grouped under two categories. The
                                first
                                category consists of the features absolutely necessary for the basic foundation of the
                                application. The features which would consist of the core idea implementation and the
                                basic
                                reason as to why the application was developed at the first place. The second category
                                consists
                                of features and implementations which would enhance the application and make it market
                                ready or
                                the features which if implemented would then promote the app to release in the play
                                store
                                In the second step of gathering requirements each team member thought as an independent
                                user as
                                to what features would be necessary in the above said application. Each team members
                                came
                                out
                                with varied features some of which were essentials and others which would not be of
                                more
                                important to the actual users.</p>

                            <p><b>USER STORIES</b></p>
                            All the requirements gathered from above two steps were formulated as user stories. The
                            user
                            stories are numbered according to the priority of the requirement. That is the stories at
                            the
                            top are the features which are of at most necessary and followed by features which would
                            enhance the application as stated above. The user stories are as follows:
                            <ul>

                            While gathering requirement analysis there were also certain areas where we went overboard
                            with
                            our assumptions which were quite unnecessary. The following are the assumptions which we
                            made:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    We thought the app should take the email-id of the user to sign up for the
                                    application
                                    which
                                    was then rendered redundant after discussion with the TA as the application doesn’t
                                    require any
                                    unique identification and since the app is a offline one.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Continuing with the above point, we thought that the application should be online
                                    so
                                    that the
                                    user data can be stored in the central database and can be used to give user an
                                    analysis by
                                    comparing the data with national average and help user manage the budget. However,
                                    after
                                    discussion with the TA it was concluded that not many people are comfortable with
                                    sharing their
                                    personal budget information online and this would be a negative impact on the
                                    application.
                                </li>

                                    As discussed in the previous point, the team had thought of having a central
                                    database
                                    to
                                    store data of all users. However, the implementation of the same was found to be
                                    unnecessary
                                    and at the same time expensive after discussion with TA.

                                Screenshot 1 is of the dashboard which we get as soon as we login/sing up into the

                                consists of two parts. In the first one we can enter our monthly income and update it.
                                The
                                second part consists of the Fixed Expenditure where we enter the expenses which are

                                for

                        <h4><b>Design Pattern</b></h4>
                        <p>In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a
                            commonly
                            occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that
                            can be
                            transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a
                            problem that
                            can be used in many different situations.
                            We have used the following design patterns in our application.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>MVC – Model View Controller</b>
                                <p>MVC Pattern stands for Model-View-Controller Pattern. This pattern is used to
                                    separate
                                    application's concerns.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Model - Model represents an object carrying data. It can also have
                                        logic to update controller
                                        if its data changes.</li>

                                    <li>View - View represents the visualization of the data that model contains.</li>

                                    <li>Controller - Controller acts on both model and view. It controls the data flow
                                        into
                                        model
                                        object and updates the view whenever data changes. It keeps view and model
                                        separate.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li><b>Interface</b></li>
                            <p>
                                It is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface thereby
                                inheriting the
                                abstract methods of inheritance by which we can enforce the method usage.
                            </p>
                            <li><b>Serializable</b></li>
                            <p>
                                Converts objects or data into byte code and transfers it from one activity to another
                                activity.
                            </p>
                            <li><b>Custom Pattern</b></li>
                            <p>
                                There was a repeatable task of creating table in each activity for displaying the
                                components
                                added by the user. The method of design pattern accepts the data list, module name,
                                table
                                layout and context. We have used a custom pattern of creating tables in the required
                                activities.
                            </p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Given below shows two different activities which displays the table of contents</p>

                            <p>
                                A student is always tight on time and budget. Student, especially who stay abroad
                                always
                                have a constrain on expenditure since they have to juggle between a lot of things which
                                vary from basic necessities such as Food, shelter, clothing, Internet to educational
                                needs
                                such as text books, stationeries and other extra expenditures. Hence, it is very
                                necessary
                                that a student always has a way to somehow keep a track of her/his budget, be informed
                                if
                                at all she/he is over his monthly allowance. A more traditional way is to write down
                                all
                                the expenses one has occurred over the month, sum it up and see if she/he is below his
                                allowance or at least equal to it. However, this may be very robust at times. Also, one
                                tends to forget a few expenses over the period and there is no way to match if she/he
                                is
                                over his budget except for of course her/his inner conscious which somehow always
                                losses in
                                front of one’s greed. Budget book is an application, which not only helps a student to

                                a track of his expenditure over the time, but it also helps her/him to set monthly
                                limits
                                for various expenditure and ones he reaches a certain threshold she/he is alerted and
                                by
                                this way he can always keep a track. It also helps him visualize the expenses in a
                                pictorial form and also as a downloadable summary which he can always analyze to cut
                                down a

                                expenditure. She/he may have various sources of income apart from their income from
                                professional work. Sometimes, it just gets very frustrating to track the inflow and
                                outflow
                                of cash when you have so many incomes and a lot more expenditures especially when you

                                Also,
                                for a few individuals it’s annoying to go through numbers all the time, hence

                                also comes into picture. An Application which can not only help them keep a track of

                                a very handy tool and that is what budget book is aimed at. An individual can enter his

                        The above sequence represents how a user can add his fixed expenditure when he his using
                        the application for the first time. The user Logs in for the first time by entering a pin.
                        After he logs in, he sees a dashboard with three options namely “Add unfixed expenditure”,
                        “Update fixed components”, “Update Unfixed Limits”. He selects update fixed components
                        which prompts the user to a new screen which consists of various features as shown in the
                        figure. The user then with the help of drop down menu adds all the fixed components which
                        occur in his day to day life along with the amount and method of payment. All the entries
                        are shown below which can be deleted any time with the help of delete icon. The user can
                        also specify the payment frequency and the date of payment which helps him keep a track of
                        all the variables. Once she/he is done updating the values he can navigate back to the
                        dashboard. The sequence of operation is shown with the help of screenshots from the
                        application.

                                Since the basic prototype consisted of the entire necessary core features a few changes
                                were made regarding the core idea. However, a lot of recommended changes from the
                                client
                                were taken into account and implemented which were initially not present in the basic
                                prototype which are listed as follows:
                            </p>

                                    In the basic prototype, the mode of payment was not specified, however it is a
                                    necessary
                                    feature to be implemented so that the user can keep a track if she/he has spent
                                    using
                                    card/cash/or any other source.

                                    The option of adding Date and frequency of expenditure has been added which gives
                                    the
                                    user a hassle free experience of keeping the track on time stamp and also prevent

                                    Also, since the user can have multiple source of income we have provided the user
                                    to
                                    enter various income values which was not the case in the initial prototype.

                                enter the income of the user. Once the income has been updated, the user can then enter
                                fixed expenditure from the drop down list or the user can define her/his own category
                                and
                                specify the corresponding amount. Once he has entered the amount, the user can set the

                                by card or nay other means. Next he can also enter the date of payment which helps the

                                to keep a time log of his expenditure and finally all the entries appear as a list

                        <p>As the Beta prototype is now ready its time to test our application regressively and get to
                            know the critical, major and minor errors before the end user uses it and makes fun of it
                            or provides negative feedback on the social media. In order to test the App and also to
                            improve the performance & responsiveness of the app we applied the methods of both White
                            Box and Black box testing in our App. </p>
                        <h4><b>White Box Testing</b></h4>

                        <p>White box testing methods are applied when the internal working or structure of the code is
                            known. It is mostly performed by the Developer to know the critical bugs, redundat code, to
                            test the actual scenario for which the is intented to do.</p>

                        <p>With the help of White box testing we can get to know the code coverage which include the
                            following:

                                    In this we divide test conditions in groups. From each group we test only one

                                <p>This test is appropriate for functionalities which has logical relationships between
                                    inputs i.e; if else condition.
                                    Using this technique we deal with combination of inputs.
                                </p>

                                <h4>State Transition:</h4>
                                <p>Using state transition we pick test cases from an application where we need to test
                                    different system transitions. We can apply this when an application gives a
                                    different output for the same input depending on what has changed in the earlier
                                    state.</p>

                                <h4>Exploratory testing:</h4>
                                <p>We performed this testing to explore all the functionalities and detect any serious
                                    issues. </p>


                                <h4>Error guessing:</h4>
                                <p>We performed this testing along with equivalence partitioning and boundary value
                                    analysis. Mostly form submission were testing where we already expected the desired
                                    results.</p>

                                            In this user story we verify if the user is able to insert a 4 digit PIN in
                                            the input field and log into the application.
                                            On opening the application the first activity for new user is creating PIN
                                            for the application to secure the information in the application. Upon
                                            creating the PIN the user should be navigated to the income activity. We
                                            have tested this scenario by creating PIN as a new user and provided income
                                            details in the income field and date field.
                                            This pin only accepts numeric vales and alphabets, alphanumeric special
                                            characters are not accepted. We have tested this user story as a part of
                                            exploratory testing by providing incorrect pin, providing no pin and
                                            providing correct pin comparing the results with the expected results.

                                            equivalence class partitioning in income field we have tested by providing
                                            zero value, negative value and positive value and compared the results with
                                            the expected results to check the testing
                                            In the date field we have performed equivalence partitioning by providing
                                            the valid date, invalid date and special characters in the date field. By
                                            providing the dates that exist and dates that don’t exist we have performed
                                            boundary value analysis testing for this user story.

                                            In the expenditure field we have tested with providing the positive values,
                                            zero and negative values as a part of equivalence partitioning test. For
                                            positive flow test we have provided with positive values of expenditure and
                                            for negative flow test we have provided zero and negative values.
                                            And as part of exploratory testing we have explored the fields of comment

                                            and checked the outputs. We have used different timeframes available, the
                                            frequency of expenses, and the method of payment as inputs in the filtering

                                        <p>This user story is focused on changing the PIN set by the user to a new PIN.
                                            In this activity we have used the testing methods of error guessing testing
                                            and exploratory testing.
                                            By providing inputs we are trying to guess the output of the activity such
                                            as by providing wrong pin in the reset activity and trying to guess the
                                            error that will be displayed on the screen, providing the same pin for both
                                            the old and new pin and guessing the error and providing the correct inputs
                                            and checking whether the pin is changed message is displayed or not.
                                            Also as a part of exploratory testing we are checking what happens to the
                                            output when different inputs are provided such as wrong old pin, providing
                                            same pin for both the old and new pin, providing correct old pin and
                                            resetting the new pin, also with no inputs in the old pin field and vice
